    <h1>Meatloaf</h1>

    <h2>Meatloaf is like a loaf of bread except it is meat.</h2>

    <p>Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients
        and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. It is usually made 
        with ground beef, but can also be made with lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry,
        and seafood. For this recipe we will be using ground beef.
    </p>
    <p>The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions.
        It can easily become dry; therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist,
        like mixing in bread crumbs and egg, covering it with sauce, wrapping it, or using
        moisture-enhancin ingredients in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats,
        rich cheeses, or vegetables.
